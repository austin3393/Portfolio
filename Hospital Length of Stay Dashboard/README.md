# Hospital Length of Stay Dashboard Project

## Overview
This project focuses on developing a Tableau dashboard to help hospital leadership evaluate and improve patient **Length of Stay (LOS)** across different Diagnostic Related Group (DRG) codes. By analyzing LOS metrics and comparing them against Medicare's expected arithmetic mean LOS values, the dashboard provides actionable insights into hospital performance, highlighting areas for improvement and opportunities to optimize patient care and operational efficiency.

## Objectives
- **Evaluate LOS Performance**: Compare the hospital's average LOS for each DRG code to Medicareâ€™s expected LOS benchmarks.
- **Identify Areas of Improvement**: Highlight DRGs where the hospital is exceeding expected LOS values.
- **Assess Impact**: Determine which DRGs have the greatest impact on overall hospital revenue by considering the number of discharges.
- **Enable Demographic Insights**: Include filters and visual cues to explore LOS trends by patient demographics such as age and gender.
