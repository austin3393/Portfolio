# Multi-Stakeholder COVID Registry Proposal

## Overview
This project presents a proposal to develop a multi-stakeholder COVID-19 patient registry, led by our hospital in collaboration with MGUH, Sibley, and GW hospitals. The goal is to integrate patient data from these institutions to enhance clinical care and support research initiatives.

## Objectives
- Facilitate data sharing across hospitals with different electronic medical record (EMR) systems.
- Establish a standardized framework for data collection and interoperability.
- Enable analysis of COVID-19 patient data to improve outcomes and inform healthcare strategies.

## Approach
The project focuses on:
1. **Patient Inclusion**: Identifying COVID-19 patients based on standardized diagnosis criteria.
2. **Data Collection**: Aggregating key demographic, clinical, and treatment data.
3. **Interoperability**: Ensuring data can be analyzed seamlessly across hospitals despite differing EMR systems.
4. **Outcome Tracking**: Monitoring critical metrics such as patient outcomes, resource utilization, and demographic disparities.

## Significance
This registry will provide actionable insights to improve clinical care, streamline resource allocation, and inform public health strategies. By enabling multi-hospital collaboration, it addresses the need for robust data integration in healthcare.
