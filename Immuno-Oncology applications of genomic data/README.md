# Immuno-Oncology Applications of Genomic Data: Bladder Cancer

## Project Overview

This project was conducted as part of the **HIDS-7003-01 Final Project** 
to explore molecular and immune-related changes in **Bladder Cancer** using genomic data. 
The primary goal was to identify potential biomarkers, pathways, and immune cell types associated with different stages of bladder cancer, 
providing insights into diagnostics and treatment from an **Immuno-Oncology** perspective.
Our team specifically focused on comparing Pre-cancerous Tissue (Bladder Cancer Surrounding Mucosa) to Normal Tissue samples to uncover biomarkers and therapeutic targets. 
The ultimate goal was to facilitate the early detection of bladder cancer and prevent its progression into invasive stages.
## Major Steps

### Step 1: Differential Gene Expression Analysis (individual)
- Compared gene expression in many genes between precancerous and normal tissue.
- Performed **T-test group comparison** in R to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs).

### Step 2: Pathway and Gene Ontology Enrichment Analysis (individual)
- Conducted **pathway enrichment** and **gene ontology (GO) enrichment** analysis for DEGs (differentially expressed genes).
- Used R for systems biology analysis.

### Step 3: Immuno-Oncology Analysis (individual)
- Utilized the **CIBERSORT** package to analyze immune cell types based on gene expression data.

### Step 4: Comparative Analysis (group)
- Compared results from **pathway enrichment** and **CIBERSORT** analysis to identify key tumor-related pathways and immune responses.

### Step 5: Results and Discussion (group)
- Selected important tumor-related and immune-related pathways, top-ranked DEGs, and immune cell types.
- Discussed findings in the context of bladder cancer diagnostics and treatment.


## Key Findings

- Identified significant **differentially expressed genes (DEGs)** associated with bladder cancer progression.
- Highlighted key pathways and immune cell types involved in tumorigenesis and immune evasion.
- Provided insights into potential biomarkers for early detection and therapeutic targets in bladder cancer.
