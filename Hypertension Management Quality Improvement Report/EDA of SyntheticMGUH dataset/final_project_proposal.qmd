# SyntheticMGUH Hypertension Care Quality Improvement Report

Hypertension is a chronic medical condition characterized by persistently elevated blood pressure and is prevalent among the patient population at MGUH. Due to the increasing number of patients, the health system's hypertension clinics have become overwhelmed. In response, system administrators have tasked our team with assessing whether hypertension management can be improved in primary care clinics to reduce unnecessary referrals.

#### The objective of this analysis is twofold:

**Determine a denominator**: Identify the total number of adult patients with essential hypertension in our healthcare system.

**Evaluate care adequacy**: Quantify how many of these patients are referred to hypertension clinics without receiving adequate management in primary care.

For this study, "**adequate primary care**" for hypertension management is defined as meeting both of the following criteria before referral to a hypertension clinic:

1.  Patients should have been prescribed at least one guideline-recommended **anti-hypertensive medication**.
2.  Patients should have a **documented care plan** outlining treatment goals, follow-up schedules, and lifestyle interventions for hypertension.

#### Our analysis will follow these steps:

1.  **Data Extraction:** Identify adult patients with essential hypertension from the EHR system using relevant diagnosis codes.
2.  **Referral Analysis:** Determine how many of these patients were referred to hypertension clinics and evaluate their records for adequate primary care management.
3.  **Outcome Assessment:** Calculate the proportion of referred patients meeting the defined criteria.

If the majority of patients referred to the hypertension clinic have received adequate primary care, we will recommend implementing more stringent referral criteria to prioritize patients requiring specialized or emergency care.

In such cases, referrals to the hypertension clinic should be reserved for life-threatening conditions based on established international guidelines. We propose adopting the referral criteria outlined by the British and Irish Hypertension Society [(1)](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10803252/), which include:

-   **Malignant/Accelerated-Phase Hypertension:**

    -   Blood pressure â‰¥180/120 mmHg accompanied by retinal hemorrhages or papilledema (optic disc swelling).

-   **Hypertensive Crisis with Target-Organ Damage:**

    -   Life-threatening complications, regardless of blood pressure severity, including but not limited to: Acute Aortic Dissection, Acute Kidney Injury, Acute Myocardial Ischemia (Heart Attack), Acute Heart Failure, Acute Stroke, Pheochromocytoma

-   **Pre-Eclampsia and Severe Hypertension in Pregnancy:**

    -   Requires a multi-disciplinary team approach due to the risk to both mother and fetus.

Referral to a hypertension clinic would only be indicated given one of these criteria.

# Defining Patient Cohorts

## Hypertension patient cohort

Our hypertension cohort consists of patient records extracted from the **encounters**, **procedures**, **medications**, **conditions**, and **careplans** tables, where the corresponding `reasondescription` or `description` field indicates a diagnosis of **Essential Hypertension**.

```{sql connection = con}
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS hypertension_cohort
```

```{sql connection = con}
-- Create a common table expression (CTE) to identify all unique patients with hypertension
WITH all_hypertension_cohort AS (
  
  -- Identify patients from the 'encounters' table where the reason for the visit includes "hypertension"
  SELECT DISTINCT patient
  FROM encounters
  WHERE LOWER(reasondescription) LIKE '%hypertension%'
  
  UNION
  
  -- Identify patients from the 'procedures' table where the procedure description includes "hypertension"
  SELECT DISTINCT patient
  FROM procedures
  WHERE LOWER(reasondescription) LIKE '%hypertension%' 
  
  UNION
  
  -- Identify patients from the 'medications' table where the medication reason includes "hypertension"
  SELECT DISTINCT patient
  FROM medications
  WHERE LOWER(reasondescription) LIKE '%hypertension%'
  
  UNION 
  
  -- Identify patients from the 'conditions' table where the condition description includes "hypertension"
  SELECT DISTINCT patient
  FROM conditions
  WHERE LOWER(description) LIKE '%hypertension%'
  
  UNION
  
  -- Identify patients from the 'careplans' table where the care plan description includes "hypertension"
  SELECT DISTINCT patient
  FROM careplans
  WHERE LOWER(reasondescription) LIKE '%hypertension%'
),

-- Create a refined CTE containing demographic information for all hypertension patients
hypertension_cohort AS (
    SELECT 
        ahc.patient,              -- Patient ID from the previous CTE
        birthdate,                -- Patient's date of birth
        deathdate,                -- Patient's recorded date of death
        race,                     -- Patient's race
        ethnicity,                -- Patient's ethnicity
        gender,                   -- Patient's gender
        date_part('year', age('2020-09-24', birthdate)) as age -- Patient's age as of 2020-09-24
    FROM all_hypertension_cohort ahc
    JOIN patients ON patients.id = ahc.patient 
    -- Only include patients who were alive on or after 2019-09-24
    -- We assume a NULL deathdate means the patient is still alive
    AND (deathdate IS NULL OR deathdate > '2019-09-24')
)

-- Create a temporary table to store the final cohort of hypertension patients
SELECT *
INTO TEMP TABLE hypertension_cohort
FROM hypertension_cohort
```

## Hypertension Patients with Referral to Cardiologist Cohort

We enhanced the hypertension patient cohort by adding a **`referral`** column, indicating whether each patient has been referred to a **hypertension clinic**.

```{sql connection=con}
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS hypertension_referral_cohort
```

```{sql connection = con}

-- Create a CTE to identify patients referred to a hypertension clinic
WITH referral_cohort AS (
    -- Select distinct patients with referral procedure codes linked to encounters
    SELECT DISTINCT ON (p.patient) 
        p.patient,        -- Unique patient ID
        p.code,           -- Procedure code (referral)
        p.stop,           -- End date of the procedure
        e.reasoncode,     -- Reason code from the corresponding encounter
        1 AS referral     -- Indicator that the patient received a referral
    FROM procedures p
    LEFT JOIN encounters e ON p.encounter = e.id -- Link procedures to encounters by encounter ID
    WHERE p.code = 183856001    -- Procedure code for referral to hypertension clinic
    AND e.reasoncode = 59621000 -- Reason code for essential hypertension
),

-- Create another CTE combining patient demographic data with referral data
hypertension_referral_cohort AS (
    SELECT 
        hc.patient,             -- Patient ID from the hypertension cohort
        hc.birthdate,           -- Patient's date of birth
        hc.deathdate,           -- Patient's date of death (if applicable)
        hc.race,                -- Patient's race
        hc.ethnicity,           -- Patient's ethnicity
        hc.gender,              -- Patient's gender
        hc.age,                 -- Patient's calculated age
        rc.referral,            -- Indicator of referral from the referral cohort
        rc.stop AS referral_stop_date -- Date when the referral procedure was completed
    FROM hypertension_cohort hc
    LEFT JOIN referral_cohort rc ON hc.patient = rc.patient
    -- Ensure only active patients are included (alive after the cutoff date)
    AND (hc.deathdate IS NULL OR hc.deathdate > '2019-09-24')
)

-- Create a temporary table to store the final referral cohort data
SELECT *
INTO TEMP TABLE hypertension_referral_cohort
FROM hypertension_referral_cohort;
```

## Proportion of Hypertension Patients and Referrals

```{sql connection = con}
-- Calculate percentage
SELECT
    SUM(referral) AS referred_patients,
    COUNT(DISTINCT patient) AS total_hypertension_patients,
    SUM(referral) * 100.0 / COUNT(DISTINCT patient) AS percentage_referred -- percentage of hypertension patients referred to the cardiologist 
FROM hypertension_referral_cohort hc
```

Our hypertension cohort includes 9,418 patients, of whom 207 were referred to a hypertension clinic, representing 2.20% of the total cohort.

# Demographics

### Gender

The gender breakdown is weighted towards men.

```{sql connection=con}
    SELECT gender, count(*) as patients
    FROM hypertension_referral_cohort
    WHERE referral = 1
    GROUP BY gender
```

### Age

```{sql connection=con}
    SELECT floor(age/10)*10 as age_group, count(*) patients
    FROM hypertension_referral_cohort
    WHERE referral =1 
    GROUP BY age_group ORDER BY age_group
```

# Compliance with Primary Care Protocols for Hypertensive Care

## Care Plans

How many hypertension patients with a referral have a hypertension-related care plan?

```{sql connection = con}

WITH cp AS (
SELECT DISTINCT patient, stop, 1 AS care_plan
FROM careplans
WHERE description LIKE '%hypertension%'
),

cp_cohort AS (
SELECT DISTINCT hc.patient, cp.stop AS cp_stop_date, hc.referral_stop_date, care_plan, referral
FROM hypertension_referral_cohort hc
LEFT JOIN cp ON hc.patient = cp.patient
WHERE cp.stop IS NULL OR cp.stop < hc.referral_stop_date
AND (hc.deathdate IS NULL OR hc.deathdate > '2019-09-24')
)

SELECT SUM(care_plan) AS care_plan_patients, 
       SUM(referral) AS referral_patients, 
       SUM(care_plan) * 100.0/SUM(referral) AS percent_with_careplans
FROM cp_cohort
WHERE referral = 1

/* 29046, 4023, 32968, 5640, 111280, 259255, 197313, 2027, 1045, 5489, 2071, 1977, 6918, 8659, 11289, 309362, 3522, 6902 */

```

All **hypertension patients with a referral** (100%) have a documented **hypertension-related care plan** in their medical records.

## Medications

How many hypertension patients with a referral are on at least one of the recommended anti-hypertensive medications prior to the referral?

### proportion of hypertension referral patients with hypertension medications

```

All **hypertension patients with a referral** (100%) have been prescribed an appropriate **anti-hypertensive medication.**

# Adding more stringent criteria

Since all patients in our **hypertension-referral cohort** have met the criteria for **basic primary care hypertension management**, we will implement **more stringent referral standards** as outlined in the introduction.

## Malignant/accelerated phase hypertension. Blood pressure â‰¥180/120

What percent of hypertension patients with a referral have had their most recent lab test show a systolic BP greater than 180 and a diastolic BP greater than 120?

```{sql connection = con}
WITH recent_bp_readings AS (
    -- Get the most recent systolic and diastolic BP readings per patient
    SELECT 
        o.patient, 
        o.code, 
        o.description, 
        CAST(o.value AS FLOAT) AS value_float,
        o.date
    FROM observations o
    LEFT JOIN encounters e ON o.encounter = e.id
    WHERE e.reasondescription LIKE '%hypertension%' 
    AND o.code IN ('8480-6', '8462-4') -- Systolic and Diastolic BP codes
    AND date <= '2020-09-24'
    ORDER BY o.patient, o.code, o.date DESC
),

most_recent_bp AS (
    -- Use DISTINCT ON to keep the latest systolic and diastolic readings per patient
    SELECT DISTINCT ON (patient, code)
        patient, 
        code, 
        value_float, 
        description, 
        date
    FROM recent_bp_readings
    ORDER BY patient, code, date DESC
)


SELECT 
    DISTINCT patient, 
    description,
    value_float
FROM 
    most_recent_bp bp
WHERE 
    (bp.code = '8480-6' AND bp.value_float >= 180) -- Systolic BP
    OR
    (bp.code = '8462-4' AND bp.value_float >= 120) -- Diastolic BP


    
```

It turns out that no patients in our hypertension referral cohort have had their most recent lab test fulfill the aforementioned systolic/diastolic BP criteria.

## Hypertensive Crisis with Target-Organ Damage

What percent of hypertension patients with a referral have a life-threatening condition that could trigger a hypertensive crises?

```{sql connection = con}
WITH numbered_conditions AS (
    SELECT 
        patient, 
        CASE 
            WHEN LOWER(reasondescription) ~* 'acute aortic dissection|acute kidney injury|acute myocardial ischaemia|acute heart failure|stroke|phaeochromocytoma' THEN 1
            ELSE 0
        END AS hypertensive_crisis_condition
    FROM encounters
),

hypertensive_crises_cohort AS (
SELECT 
    patient,
    MAX(hypertensive_crisis_condition) AS hypertensive_crisis_condition
FROM numbered_conditions
GROUP BY patient
),
joined_hypertension_cohort AS (
SELECT hr.patient, referral, hypertensive_crisis_condition
FROM hypertension_referral_cohort hr
LEFT JOIN hypertensive_crises_cohort hc
ON hr.patient = hc.patient
WHERE referral = 1
)

SELECT 
  SUM(hypertensive_crisis_condition) AS hypertensive_crises_condition_patients,
  SUM(referral) AS total_referral_patients,
  SUM(hypertensive_crisis_condition) * 100.0/SUM(referral) AS percent_with_crisis_condition
FROM joined_hypertension_cohort

```

None of the patients in our cohort have such a life-threatening condition.

## Pre-Eclampsia and Severe Hypertension in Pregnancy

What percent of hypertension patients with a referral have the condition, preâ€“eclampsia?

```{sql connection = con}
WITH preeclampsia_cohort AS (
SELECT DISTINCT patient, 1 AS preeclampsia
FROM conditions
WHERE LOWER(description) LIKE '%preeclampsia%'
),

joined_hypertension_cohort AS (
SELECT DISTINCT hr.patient, hr.referral, p.preeclampsia
FROM hypertension_referral_cohort hr
LEFT JOIN preeclampsia_cohort p 
ON hr.patient = p.patient
WHERE referral = 1
)

SELECT SUM(preeclampsia) AS preeclampsia_patients,
  SUM(referral) AS total_referral_patients,
  SUM(preeclampsia) * 100.0 / SUM(referral) AS percent_with_preeclampsia
FROM joined_hypertension_cohort
```

Based on the **more stringent referral criteria**, only **6.76% (14 patients)** of the **hypertension cohort referred to a hypertension clinic** were appropriately referred due to **pre-eclampsia**.
