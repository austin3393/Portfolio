# Addressing Essential Hypertension Management Deficiency

## Project Overview

This project focuses on improving the management of **essential hypertension** in primary care to address the challenge of overwhelmed hypertension clinics. By designing and implementing a new **EMR-based workflow**, we aim to reduce inappropriate referrals to specialty hypertension clinics and enhance patient outcomes. 

---

## Key Objectives

1. **Identify Gaps:** Analyze electronic medical records in Synthea using PostgreSQL to identify deficiencies in the primary care management of hypertension.
2. **Develop Interventions:** Create a streamlined workflow in OpenEMR (fake EHR) to improve care delivery and referral criteria.
3. **Report Outcome** Report the effectiveness of the workflow in reducing unnecessary referrals and improving patient management using a Tableau Dashboard.

---

## Tools Used

- **OpenEMR:** For workflow implementation and patient data management.
- **Tableau:** For data visualization and tracking key performance indicators (KPIs).
- **PostgreSQL and Synthetic MGUH Dataset:** For cohort identification and analysis.

---

## Pilot Results

The pilot implementation demonstrated:
- A significant reduction in inappropriate referrals to the hypertension clinic.
- Improved compliance with hypertension management protocols among primary care providers.
- Positive feedback from staff on the usability and effectiveness of the workflow.

## Next Steps

1. **Full-Scale Implementation:** Expand the workflow to additional primary care clinics.
2. **Provider-Focused Dashboards:** Develop dashboards for real-time insights into performance and adherence.
3. **Ongoing Training:** Provide training sessions to ensure effective adoption across clinics.
4. **Continuous Feedback:** Collect feedback from clinicians to refine the workflow and address challenges.
