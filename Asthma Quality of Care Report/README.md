# Asthma Care Quality Analysis Using SyntheticMGUH Database

## Overview
This project analyzes the quality of asthma care within the **SyntheticMGUH database**, focusing on patient data from October 2022 to October 2023. The goal is to evaluate adherence to asthma care guidelines and identify areas for improvement in patient management. By defining a clear patient cohort and analyzing key demographic and clinical data, this project aims to enhance the understanding of asthma care practices and outcomes.

## Objectives
- **Define Patient Cohort**: Identify asthma patients based on diagnoses, prescriptions, and treatment encounters.
- **Evaluate Care Quality**: Assess adherence to care guidelines, including:
  - Asthma care plans.
  - Use of maintenance and rescue inhalers.
  - Pneumococcal vaccination rates.
- **Analyze Patient Demographics**: Examine age, gender, race, and smoking status to identify disparities in care.
- **Provide Insights**: Highlight gaps in asthma management and suggest areas for improvement.


## Technical Skills Demonstrated
- **SQL Proficiency**:
  - Defined cohorts using SQL queries across multiple tables (`conditions`, `medications`, `encounters`, `patients`, `careplans`, `immunizations`).
  - Ensured data consistency with SQL joins and aggregation functions.
- **Data Analysis**:
  - Evaluated demographic and clinical variables to identify trends and gaps.
  - Derived insights to improve asthma care quality.
- **Data Visualization**:
  - Created histograms and density plots for age distribution using R.
  - Highlighted key findings in visual formats to support analysis.

## Conclusion
The project reveals critical gaps in asthma care, such as low pneumococcal vaccination rates, and demonstrates how systematic data analysis can guide improvements in patient management. By leveraging synthetic data and SQL-based methods, this analysis serves as a foundation for enhancing real-world asthma care practices.
